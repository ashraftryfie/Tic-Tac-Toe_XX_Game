# TicTacToe (XX) Board 🎮

This project is a Python program that lets you play TicTacToe (XX) against an AI opponent. TicTacToe (XX) is a variation of the classic TicTacToe game where you need to make two lines of X's instead of one to win.

## Features 🌟

- Play on a 4x4 board (or bigger dimension) with **X's Only**
- Choose from two difficulty levels: easy or hard
- Easy mode uses the Minimax algorithm to find the best move
- Hard mode uses the Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to find the best move faster
- Use the arrow keys and the space bar to make your move
- See the score and the winner at the end of the game
